# Serverless Image Resizer with LocalStack & Terraform

This is a simple example of how to use LocalStack to create a serverless image resizer using AWS Lambda and S3. The image resizer is implemented in Python and uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to resize images.

## Requirements

- LocalStack with the [`lstk` CLI](https://docs.localstack.cloud/aws/developer-tools/running-localstack/lstk/).
- [Terraform CLI](https://www.terraform.io/downloads).
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/) is required by `lstk aws`.
- A valid [LocalStack for AWS license](https://localstack.cloud/pricing). Your license provides a [`LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN`](https://docs.localstack.cloud/aws/getting-started/auth-token/) to activate LocalStack.

## Start LocalStack

Start LocalStack Pro with the `LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN` pre-configured:

```bash
export LOCALSTACK_AUTH_TOKEN=<your-auth-token>
make start
```

## Build the Lambda function

To build the Lambda function, you need to create a ZIP archive with the Python code and the required dependencies. You can use the following commands to create the ZIP archive:

```bash
docker run --platform linux/x86_64 --rm -v "$PWD":/var/task "public.ecr.aws/sam/build-python3.11" /bin/sh -c "pip3 install -r requirements.txt -t libs; exit"

cd libs && zip -r ../lambda.zip . && cd ..
zip lambda.zip lambda_function.py
rm -rf libs
```

## Deploy the infrastructure

To run this example you need to execute:

```bash
lstk tf init
lstk tf plan
lstk tf apply --auto-approve
```

After the Terraform script has been applied, you can upload an image to the S3 bucket and check the resized image in the `resized` folder. Here is an example:

```bash
lstk aws s3 cp image.png s3://original-images/image.png
lstk aws s3 ls s3://resized-images
```

## Run the tests

You can run tests using the Terraform Test framework:

```bash
lstk tf test
```
